        <p>Here is a short description of a penguin:</p>
        <p>"They have a large head, short neck, and elongated body. Their tails are short, stiff, and wedge-shaped. Their legs and webbed feet are set far back on the body, which gives penguins their upright posture on land. When snow conditions are right, they will slide on their bellies."</p>
