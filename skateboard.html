        <p>Here is a short description of the trick:</p>
        <p>"A tre flip, also known as a 360 flip or 360 kickflip, is a skateboarding trick that involves flipping an ollie off the ground, landing on the back foot, and flipping the board over and riding it in the other direction. 
            The board spins 360 degrees mid-air and flips 360 degrees along its longitudinal axis. This trick is a combination of a backside 360 pop shove-it and a kickflip. 
            It's considered one of the most iconic tricks in skateboarding."</p>

        <p>Here is a short description of the trick:</p>
        <p>"A darkslide is a trick where the rider slides on the underside of a board while the board is upside down. The rider uses their grip tape to slide along the board's edge and then flips the board upside down. The rider's weight is placed on their back foot through the slide. 
            Darkslides are considered one of the hardest tricks to do, but they are also very satisfying. They can destroy a deck's integrity quickly because of the negative flexing when sliding."</p>
